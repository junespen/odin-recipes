    <h1>The Perfect Basic Burger</h1>
    <img src="../img/burger.jpg" alt="Picture of a burger">
    <h2>These burger patties are made with ground beef and an easy bread crumb mixture.</h2>
    <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into Â¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.</p>
    <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>
